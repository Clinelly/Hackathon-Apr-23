### **Project Goals**
This section aims to make a positive difference in the mental health and well-being of veterans. 

Our vision is to help veterans in their transition to getting back to life and working as any other civilian.
As most of the veterans face too many questions about what to do and how life is after their’s serving, we aim to get them together by sharing their’s histories and finding others in similar situations – being able to express their feelings and challenges without being judged (for this reason, an anonymous user feature has been implemented).
