# Project Overview
Peer Support Platform 
A web app that connects veterans seeking mental health support with other veterans who have experienced similar challenges. The platform could include a matching system, private messaging, and group discussions (blog) to facilitate communication and support.

This platform was built using Django, Python, JavaScript and Bootstrap 4. The site was deployed on Heroku and uses Cloudinary for cloud storage.

**Charlee Charlee One** is Team 2: Stamp Out The Stigma project submission for **Code Institute** and **Social Soda** Hackathon, April 2023.
